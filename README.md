# Indihire Technical Assignment

## Steps I followed while building this application

1. Project setup:
   - Created a new project using Angular CLI: `ng new indihire_assignment --style=scss --routing=false`
2. Connected GitHub repository:
   - Initialized Git: `git init`
   - Committed the starter template: `git commit -m "starter_template"`
   - Set the branch to main: `git branch -M main`
   - Added the remote origin: `git remote add origin https://github.com/alalUDDIN123/indihire_assignment.git`
   - Pushed the code to GitHub: `git push -u origin main`
3. Created two components:
   - Navbar component: `ng g c navbar`
   - Transform section component: `ng g c transform-section`
4. Installed Font Awesome library and registered it in `app.module.ts`:
   - Installed packages: `npm install @fortawesome/angular-fontawesome@0.13.0 @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core@6.4.0 @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons@6.4.0`
